  <p>
    Will "ordinary citizens" obey a researcher's orders to inflict painful electric shocks upon a person, against the person's will?<br/>
    What factors influence obedience?
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <strong>Overall research program.</strong><br/>
    Experimental.<br/>
   The situation is systematically changed from study to study and effects on behaviour are observed.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <strong>Independent variable.</strong><br/>
    Variables are manipulated, one at a time(e.g., Teacher can or cannot see the Learner;
    Experimenter gives orders in person or by phone)
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <p>
    <strong>Dependent Variable.</strong><br/>
    Level of obedience (as measured byt the highest intensity of shock delivered by the Teacher to the Learner)
